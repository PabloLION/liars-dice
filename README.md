# Lair’s Dice by self-play
I’ve been meaning to learn about AIs for [games like Poker or Liar’s Dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information) for a while. Recently while reading Deepmind’s article [Player of Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03178), I thought I might be able to make something really simple that works well enough to be fun. “It shouldn’t take more than an afternoon,” I thought. Of course, I ended up spending much more time on it, but it did turn out to be fun and very simple.

Play against the ai on [dudo.ai](http://dudo.ai/).
